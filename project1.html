			<h3>UCSD App ReDesign</h3>
			<h4>Project Overview</h4>
			<p>This is a personal project that I worked on while I was taking DSGN 1. I was brainstorming ideas for the final project and the UCSD app was one of them
                Although we did not choose this as our final project. I decided to continue working on it so I can practice the skills that I learned from class.
            </p>
            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>
                There were a few problems that students faced with the app such as there is a lot of scrolling and it is very busy, that it takes for a
                while for the user to pinpoint where the information they are lookign for is at, or studnets to have not even heard about it>
            </p>
			<h4>Research</h4>
			<p>Since this was a side project while working on the final project for DSGN 1 I did not have the opprunity to professionaly interview users or students, so I mostly relied on what my close friends thought about the app,
                 my own personal experince and looking on differnet social platofrms such as reddit to see what people have said about the app.
