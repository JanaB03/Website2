			<h3>UCSD App ReDesign</h3>
			<h4>Project Overview</h4>
			<p>This is a personal project that I worked on while I was taking DSGN 1. I was brainstorming ideas for the final project and the UCSD app was one of them
                Although we did not choose this as our final project. I decided to continue working on it so I can practice the skills that I learned from class.
            </p>
            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>
                There were a few problems that students faced with the app such as there is a lot of scrolling and it is very busy that it takes  a while for the user to pinpoint where the information they are looking for is at, or students have not even heard about it
            </p>
			<p>
				One of the problem that some users complained about is that there is a lot of "cards" that they do not use. This probelm is fixed by being able
			to adjust what "card" you would like to see through the settings section at the top right. Some users suggested that they would rather see the card that they 
			want first thing when they open the app instead of scrolling all the way which can lead to a user mistake by skipping their desired card. 
					</p>

                <img src="old3.png" width="200" height="400" alt="old3">
                <img src="old4.png" width="200" height="400" alt="old4">
              </p>
			<h4>Research</h4>
			<p>Since this was a side project while working on the final project for DSGN 1 I did not have the opportunity to professionally interview users or students, so I mostly relied on what my close friends thought about the app, my own personal experience and looking on different social platforms such as reddit to see what people have said about the app.
            </p>
			<h4>Design</h4>
			<p>To come up with a redesign, I used the double diamond method. I used wireframes to sketch out the pages of the app. I focused on making it very simple and less scrolling as compared to the original app. 
            But I also kept the same format as the orginal app but change the ouline of it. Two users stated that they use a one card daily but 
			still uses the rest. So I focused into making the card that they look at daily more accessible.

			<h4>Results</h4>
			<p>I redesigned the app in a way that is more simple and the user will be able to swipe and select what front page they will want to see. Then on top there are slides with images that show the recent news and events at UCSD. 
				I kept the same color scheme and format of the original app.

            </p>
			<h4>Reflection</h4>
			<p>If I were to actually work on this project and expand it even further I would focus on gaining interviews and feedback from users. I would also focus on the aesthetic of it. As well I create a prototype and test by gaining feedback from the users.
